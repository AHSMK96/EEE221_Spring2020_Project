The images below were taken from HevLfreis' respository that was also creating a code to detect traffic light.
This respository was accessed on 4/6/2020, therefore, it is not known if it has been updated since then.
Here is a link to his repository is: https://github.com/HevLfreis/TrafficLight-Detector
