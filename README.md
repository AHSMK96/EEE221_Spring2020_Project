Traffic Light Detection

This respository contains programs and files for a school project.
The class is for EEE221- Machine Learning in CSU-Sacramento.


The project was done with two people:
  Kenneth Mercado
  Ahmed Saad
  
  Objective:
    Detect traffic light using a Raspberry Pi and a Raspberry Pi camera.
    The program should detect the traffic lights live.
    
There are two codes in this respository
  - One is for detecting traffic lights on still images.
        This was used to practice/test and get a feel on the HSV range and Hough transform circle detection parameters.
  - The other one is for detecting traffic lights on a live camera (the Raspberry Pi camera)
        This is the final code used to achieve the objective.
