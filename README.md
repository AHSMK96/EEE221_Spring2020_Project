Traffic Light Detection

This respository contains programs and files for a school project.
The class is for EEE221- Machine Learning in CSU-Sacramento.

The project was done with two people:
  Kenneth Mercado
  Ahmed Saad

Objective:
    Detect traffic light using a Raspberry Pi and a Raspberry Pi camera.
    The program should detect the traffic lights live.
    
There are two codes in this respository:
  - "traffLightDet_stillImg.py"
        This was used to practice/test and get a feel on the HSV range and Hough transform circle detection parameters for still images.
  - "traffLightDet_liveCam.py"
        This is the final code used to achieve the objective with the raspberry pi camera.
        
There is a Reference text document that lists all sources used during the project.

There is a folder called "Images" that contains all images involved in this project.

There is a folder called "Videos" that contains all videos involved in this project.
