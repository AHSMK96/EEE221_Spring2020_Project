# Still Images Documentation

This folder contains two folders with images:
  - "Images Used For Testing"
  - "Image Results"
  
The "Images Used For Testing" folder contains images that were used to test the "traffLightDet_stillImg.py" code.
Inside this folder we have:
  The images that were taken from Kenneth Mercado via phone:
    - 'greenlight01.png'
    - 'greenlight02.png'
    - 'redlight01.png'
    - 'redlight02.png'

  The images that were taken from HevLfreis' respository, where they were also trying to detect traffice light.
  This respository was accessed on 4/6/2020, therefore, it is not known if it has been updated since then.
